# NavPi

Dev notes on the [NavPi Stake Box](https://github.com/Encrypt-S/navpi) project

Rough drafts of content, configs, and support docs.

For official documentation, refer to the [NavPi Knowledge Base](https://info.navcoin.org/article-categories/navpi/)

## Focus

- audit current version of NavPi (functionality, setup, support, docs)
- create updated content to enhance stability and support NAV community

## Improving performance

The current NavPi configuration is in need of a performance optimisation.

Currently, the following options are available depending upon your preference:

  - [SD swap](sd-swap-drive.md)
  - [USB swap](usb-swap-drive.md)
